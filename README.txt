Building a responsive email - for fun

This is responsive email, using @media queries.

It’s the first of 4, so I can observe the differences.

It’s not tested for any specific email clients, or device, however it should get through them all.

I may fully test at a latter date.

If you are looking for a fully tested responsive email template try Litmus or Email on Acid as they distribute copies that can be used immediately.

This is a free source. You can download the project from GitHub.

I’am building this as I like using git and it may be useful to someone.
